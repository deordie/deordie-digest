[Incrementally Adopting Dagster at Mapbox](https://medium.com/dagster-io/incrementally-adopting-dagster-at-mapbox-b635b1118594) — Ben Pleasanton @ Dagster Blog.

*We all know that Dagster may be (and maybe already is) the Next Big Thing after Airflow. But how many success stories did you read? Yes, adoption grows, but something impossible with Airflow? Well, folks from Mapbox hit the wall of complexity with Airflow, and they choose Dagster to cope with this complexity.*
