[Courses: Intro to Database Systems (Fall 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbohkNBWQs_otTrBTrjyohi), [Advanced Database Systems (Spring 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjasmrEd2_Yi1deeE360zv5O) — Andy Pavlo.

**Intro to Database Systems**

*This is a very fundamental and wide course about the implementation and design concepts behind database management systems.*

**Advanced Database Systems**

*This is continuous of the first course and will cover more advanced topics about databases such as multi-version concurrency control, detailed talk about join algorithms, and query optimization implementation.*

*These courses require a lot of time and discipline from the listeners, but you will be rewarded with very useful information about databases. And also, Andy Pavlo is a little bit strange, but a very impressive guy and very love databases :)*

*PS: Here is a more than 1000 pages [book](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz-Professor/dp/0078022150/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Database+System+Concepts&qid=1631283019&s=books&sr=1-2) which Andy recommended.*
