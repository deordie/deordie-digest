[Streaming 101: The world beyond batch: Part I](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101/), [Part II](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102/) — Tyler Akidau.

*Here are two fundamental articles that help you go deeper into streaming theory and understand the key difference between batch and stream processing in terms of time. Help you collect the right questions that you should ask yourself when you work with watermarks, triggers, and windows. These articles have changed my understanding forever, and I hope they will change yours.*
