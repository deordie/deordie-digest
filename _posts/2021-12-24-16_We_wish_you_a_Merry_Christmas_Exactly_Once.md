[Exactly-Once Semantics Are Possible: Here’s How Kafka Does It](https://www.confluent.io/blog/exactly-once-semantics-are-possible-heres-how-apache-kafka-does-it/) (Proposal: [KIP-98](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-98+-+Exactly+Once+Delivery+and+Transactional+Messaging)) — Neha Narkhede @ Confluent Blog

*This is a very interesting explanation about reaching exactly-once semantics. These are just two simple words, but this is very not trivial. You should keep in mind many different things and consider different failure scenarios. I think this understanding can help you when you design your pipelines.*
